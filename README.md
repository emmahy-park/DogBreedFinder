# TechMockInterview Homework Assignment: Using the Dog API in a Nuxt.js Application

This application allows users to view a random dog image when the page loads.
It also enables users to fetch a new random dog image by clicking a button.
Additionally, users can select a breed from a dropdown menu, and upon selection, a random image of the chosed breed will be displayed.
The application is built using Nuxt.js and Bootstrap.
